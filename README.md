#### Explanation

The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Each bit represents a power of 2. The table shows the binary representations of decimal numbers from 0 to 10, how each bit corresponds to powers of 2, and their equivalent values in the decimal system.

- **Bit**: The number in the decimal system.
- **Binary**: The binary representation of each decimal number.
- **Exponential**: The value of each bit expressed as a power of 2.
- **Decimal**: The decimal equivalent of the binary value.

For example, the decimal number 5 is written as 0101 in binary. This is calculated as 2^2 + 2^0 (4 + 1), which equals 5 in the decimal system. This system is widely used in digital electronics and computer science.

IP addresses are categorized into classes to better manage networks. These classes differ based on the size and purpose of the network. Classes A, B, and C are suitable for different network scales, while Class D is used for multicast, and Class E is reserved for experimental use.

### Explanation:

- #### Class A IP Address
  - Used for large networks. The first octet (0‚Äì127) represents the network portion.
  - **Example Address:** 10.0.0.1
  - **Explanation:** 10.0.0.1 is a Class A IP address. Class A is used in large networks with a wide range of addresses. The first octet (10) represents the network part, while the remaining three (0.0.1) are for host identification.
  - **Usable Range:** 1.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.255.255.255

- #### Class B IP Address

### <div align="center">IP Address Classes and Calculations</div>

IP addresses are classified based on the size and usage of networks. Each class has different address ranges, subnet masks, and calculation methods.

### <div align="center">IP Calculations</div>

#### **Subnet Calculation**
Subnets are used to divide a block of IP addresses into smaller networks. When subnetting, the network ID and host ID are defined.

**Example:**  
If a network uses the 192.168.1.0/24 IP block:
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- First IP Address (Network ID): 192.168.1.0  
- Last IP Address (Broadcast): 192.168.1.255  
- Usable IP Range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254 (Total of 254 hosts)

#### **Subnet Mask**
A subnet mask is used to distinguish the network and host portions of an IP address. CIDR notation (e.g., /24, /16) represents this mask.

**Example:**
- **/24** Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- **/16** Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0

#### **CIDR Notation**
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) allows for more flexible representation of IP addresses and subnets.

**Example:**  
192.168.1.0/24 represents 256 IP addresses and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

#### **Usable IP Count Calculation**
The number of usable IP addresses in a subnet is calculated with the formula:  
`Usable IPs = 2^(32 - CIDR) - 2`

**Example:**
- For /24: 2^(32 - 24) - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254 usable IPs  
- For /16: 2^(32 - 16) - 2 = 65,536 - 2 = 65,534 usable IPs

#### **Wildcard Mask**
A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask and is often used in ACLs (Access Control Lists) and other security configurations.

**Example:**
- For subnet mask 255.255.255.0, the wildcard mask is: 0.0.0.255

### Example Calculations

**Network:** 192.168.1.0/24  
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- CIDR Notation: /24  
- Usable IP Range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254  
- Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255  
- Total Hosts: 254

**Network:** 10.0.0.0/8  
- Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0  
- CIDR Notation: /8  
- Usable IP Range: 10.0.0.1 - 10.255.255.254  
- Broadcast Address: 10.255.255.255  
- Total Hosts: 16,777,214
